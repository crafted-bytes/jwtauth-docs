## JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Structure" icon="layer-group">
    JWTs consist of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature, each base64-encoded and separated by dots
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stateless" icon="cloud">
    Tokens carry all necessary information, reducing database queries and improving performance
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secure" icon="shield-halved">
    Digital signatures ensure token integrity and authenticity using cryptographic algorithms
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flexible" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Can include custom claims for additional user data or permissions

## Token Types

JWT Auth Pro implements a dual-token system for enhanced security. The system uses two distinct types of tokens:

### Access Tokens
Short-lived tokens used for API authentication. They:
- Carry user identity and permissions
- Are included in the Authorization header for API requests
- Have configurable expiration times
- Are validated on each request

### Refresh Tokens
Long-lived tokens used to maintain user sessions. They:
- Are used to obtain new access tokens
- Are stored securely in the database
- Implement secure token rotation
- Help maintain persistent authentication

## Token Lifecycle

Understanding how tokens are managed throughout their lifetime:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creation">
    Tokens are generated upon successful authentication with user credentials
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validation">
    Each API request validates the token's signature, expiration, and claims
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refresh">
    Access tokens are renewed using refresh tokens before expiration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Revocation">
    Tokens can be invalidated for security events or user actions
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is a security feature that helps protect your API from abuse by limiting the number of requests a client can make within a specific time window.

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request Tracking">
    Each request is tracked based on the client's IP address
  </Step>
  <Step title="Window Management">
    Requests are counted within a configurable time window (default: 1 minute)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Limit Enforcement">
    When limits are exceeded (default: 60 requests per minute per IP), requests are blocked with a 429 (Too Many Requests) response
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reset Period">
    After the time window expires, the request count resets automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Rate Limit Headers

JWT Auth Pro includes standard rate limit headers in API responses:

<ResponseField name="X-RateLimit-Limit" type="integer">
  Maximum number of requests allowed in the current time window
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="X-RateLimit-Remaining" type="integer">
  Number of requests remaining in the current time window
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="X-RateLimit-Reset" type="timestamp">
  Unix timestamp when the current time window expires
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Retry-After" type="integer">
  Seconds to wait before making another request (only present when rate limited)
</ResponseField>

### Default Limits

Different endpoints have different rate limits to balance security and usability:

- **Authentication**: 5 requests per minute per IP
  - Protects against brute force attacks
  - Applies to token generation endpoints

- **Token Validation**: 60 requests per minute per token
  - Higher limit for API operations
  - Applies to protected endpoints

- **Token Refresh**: 10 requests per minute per refresh token
  - Moderate limit for token renewal
  - Prevents refresh token abuse

<Note>
  All rate limits are configurable through the WordPress admin interface or using filters. See the [Configuration](/wordpress/configuration#rate-limiting) documentation for more details.
