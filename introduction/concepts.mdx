## JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

JSON Web Tokens are an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. In WordPress REST API authentication:

  <Card title="Structure" icon="layer-group">
    JWTs consist of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature, each base64-encoded and separated by dots
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stateless" icon="cloud">
    Tokens carry all necessary information, reducing database queries and improving performance
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secure" icon="shield-halved">
    Digital signatures ensure token integrity and authenticity using cryptographic algorithms
  </Card>

    Can include custom claims for additional user data or permissions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Token Types

JWT Auth Pro implements a dual-token system for enhanced security. The system uses two distinct types of tokens:

### Access Tokens
Short-lived tokens used for API authentication. They:
- Carry user identity and permissions
- Are included in the Authorization header for API requests
- Have configurable expiration times
- Are validated on each request

### Refresh Tokens
Long-lived tokens used to maintain user sessions. They:
- Are used to obtain new access tokens
- Are stored securely in the database
- Implement secure token rotation
- Help maintain persistent authentication

## Token Lifecycle

Understanding how tokens are managed throughout their lifetime:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creation">
    Tokens are generated upon successful authentication with user credentials
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validation">
    Each API request validates the token's signature, expiration, and claims
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refresh">
    Access tokens are renewed using refresh tokens before expiration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Revocation">
    Tokens can be invalidated for security events or user actions
  </Step>
</Steps>
