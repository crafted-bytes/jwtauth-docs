All settings can be managed through the WordPress admin interface at **Settings > JWT Auth Pro**. Let's explore the available configuration options.

## Token Settings

Configure how JWT tokens are generated and managed:

### Available Options:

- **JWT Expiration**: Control how long access tokens remain valid (default: 7 days)
- **Refresh Token Expiration**: Set the lifespan of refresh tokens (default: 30 days)
- **Signing Algorithm**: Choose the algorithm for token signing (default: HS256)
- **CORS Support**: Enable/disable CORS for cross-origin requests

## User Settings

Control token behavior based on user actions:

- **Revoke on Password Change**: Automatically revoke all tokens when a user changes their password (default: true)
- **Revoke on Role Change**: Revoke tokens when a user's role is modified (default: true)
- **Revoke on Email Change**: Invalidate tokens when a user updates their email (default: true)
- **Delete on User Delete**: Remove all tokens when a user is deleted (default: true)

## Data Management

Configure how JWT Auth Pro handles data:

- **Analytics Retention**: Control how long authentication analytics are stored (options: 30, 90, 180, 360 days, or Forever)

<Warning>
  Setting Analytics Retention to "Forever" may significantly increase your database size over time, depending on your site's traffic and authentication activity. Consider using a finite retention period for optimal performance.
</Warning>

- **Delete on Deactivation**: Choose whether to remove all plugin data upon deactivation (default: true)

<Warning>
  When Delete on Deactivation is enabled, all plugin data will be permanently deleted upon plugin deactivation. This action cannot be undone, and data can only be recovered if you have a database backup prior to deactivation.
</Warning>

- **Anonymize IP**: Option to anonymize IP addresses in analytics data (default: false)

<Note>
  All configuration options can be managed through the WordPress admin interface at **Settings > JWT Auth Pro**. The constants in `wp-config.php` are optional and will override the settings in the admin interface if defined.
