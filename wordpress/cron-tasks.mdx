## Daily Analytics Aggregation

**Hook Name**: `jwt_auth_daily_analytics`
**Schedule**: Daily at midnight (UTC)

This task aggregates the analytics data from the previous day into summary records for efficient dashboard access. The aggregation process collects and summarizes:
- Total requests
- Successful vs failed requests
- Unique users
- Average response times
- Event types (token generation, validation, refresh)

## Weekly Analytics Consolidation

**Hook Name**: `jwt_auth_weekly_consolidation`
**Schedule**: Weekly on Monday at 1 AM (UTC)

This task performs a deeper consolidation of analytics data:
- Processes data from the previous 7 complete days
- Ensures data consistency
- Optimizes storage and query performance
- Maintains historical trends and patterns

## Analytics Cleanup

**Hook Name**: `jwt_auth_cleanup_analytics`
**Schedule**: Daily

This task manages the retention of analytics data based on your settings:
- Removes analytics records older than the configured retention period
- Respects the retention days setting from the admin dashboard
- Skips cleanup if retention is set to "forever" (-1)
- Helps maintain database performance and size

## Configuration

You can configure the tasks through the JWT Auth Pro settings panel:

1. Navigate to Settings > JWT Auth Pro > Data Management
2. Adjust the Analytics Retention Days setting
3. Configure Data Anonymization options

When the plugin is deactivated:
- All scheduled tasks are automatically removed using `wp_clear_scheduled_hook()`
- If "Delete data on deactivation" is enabled, all related data will be removed
- Database tables and options are cleaned up

## Actions and Filters

```php
// Fires after daily analytics aggregation
do_action('jwt_auth_analytics_aggregated', [
    'rows_affected' => $count,
    'start_date' => $startDate,
    'end_date' => $endDate,
]);

// Fires after weekly analytics consolidation
do_action('jwt_auth_analytics_consolidated', [
    'start_date' => $startDate,
    'end_date' => $endDate,
    'days_processed' => $count,
]);
```

<Warning>
  These actions allow you to hook into the process and perform additional tasks. Be careful when adding hooks to these actions as they run automatically in the background.
