title: API Reference
description: "JWT Auth Pro provides a set of REST API endpoints for authentication and token management. All endpoints are accessible under the `/wp-json/jwt-auth/v1` namespace."
---

## Authentication

Most endpoints require authentication using JWT tokens. To authenticate requests, include the token in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token
```

## Base URL

The base URL for all API endpoints is your WordPress site's REST API URL:

```bash
https://your-site.com/wp-json/jwt-auth/v1
```

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses include the requested data, while error responses follow this structure:

```json
{
  "code": "error_code",
  "message": "Human readable error message",
  "data": {
    "status": 403
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

API requests are subject to rate limiting based on your JWT Auth Pro settings. The current limits are:

- Authentication attempts: 5 per minute per IP
- Token validation: 60 per minute per token
- Token refresh: 10 per minute per refresh token
